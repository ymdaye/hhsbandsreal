The AI engineer successfully built the Hickory High School Band website from scratch, addressing numerous user requests incrementally. The initial phase focused on core pages, premium design principles, and setting up Netlify/StackBit compatibility. A key challenge involved handling Google Drive CORS issues for logos, which led to an intelligent system for future logo integration. Subsequent iterations expanded content, fixed routing problems with Netlify redirects, and incorporated extensive data from the original website. The project evolved to include a comprehensive fundraising section, detailed ensemble pages, and various homepage enhancements. The AI engineer consistently prioritized frontend development, leveraging React, TailwindCSS, and Framer Motion for a visually stunning and responsive experience. The current work involves implementing the latest batch of user requests, focusing on content updates and new page creation.

The user requested a visually stunning, high-converting website for the Hickory High School Band Program in Chesapeake, Virginia. Primary colors are teal (#006778) and black, with white and gray accents. The site needs to replicate and enhance content from , including pages for Staff, Payments, History, HBPA/Parents, SEVMG, and Performance Groups. Key design principles include glass-morphism, subtle shadows, rounded corners, layered design, hover animations, gradients, responsive design, and parallax scrolling. Typography should be premium with dramatic contrasts. The site must be compatible with Netlify and StackBit for visual editing, with content managed via JSON files. Subsequent requirements expanded to include various fundraiser pages (main, Craft Fair, Golf Tournament, hAwkward Ask, blank template), integration of 9th-grade information into a Join the Band page, staff page format adjustments (side-by-side directors), header visibility fixes, inclusion of BOA New Jersey photo on homepage, detailed marching show history, addition of Indoor Percussion and Winter Guard to performance groups, individual clickable pages for each ensemble, judge bios on the SEVMG page, a sponsors page (with Ocean Storage logo), removal of spirit store info, new homepage blurbs, a separate news page, and a password-protected student page with specific content.

<code_architecture>
The application features a component-based React frontend () designed for modularity and scalability. Content is structured in JSON files within the  and  directories for compatibility with visual editors like StackBit and Netlify CMS.



**Key Files and Changes:**

*   ****: This file is central to the application's structure, responsible for defining the main React application and managing all routes using React Router DOM. It has been frequently updated to include new page components as they are created (e.g., , , , , and all individual ensemble pages).
*   ****: Crucial for site navigation, it was updated to include new menu items like Fundraisers and News. Its styling was modified to address header visibility issues, changing from transparent to a solid white background for better readability. It also now integrates the  component.
*   ****: This new component was created to provide a flexible and professional system for displaying various logo variants (e.g., for light, dark, or teal backgrounds). It supports easy updates via a configuration file, essential after direct Google Drive URL issues.
*   ****: A new configuration file explicitly designed to hold the converted, direct URLs for different logo variants, allowing easy updates without code changes.
*   ****: The homepage component has been significantly refined. It now includes updated hero section imagery (BOA New Jersey photo), the new Our Program of Excellence blurb, and placeholder for the Ocean Storage logo. Spirit store information was removed, and the Elite Wind Ensemble blurb was changed.
*   ****: This page was updated to dynamically display staff members side-by-side (specifically Mitchell Reed and Yvonne Daye) and is being prepared to pull highlights directly from staff biographies instead of full descriptions.
*   ****: This content file stores staff member data and was modified to include or prepare fields for biography highlights, supporting the dynamic display on the  page.
*   ****: This page was thoroughly updated to ensure 100% accurate 2025 event information, including quick action buttons and detailed judge biographies.
*   ****: This page was refactored to make each ensemble a clickable element, leading to individual, dedicated pages for each performance group (e.g., Symphonic Band, Marching Band, Jazz Band). It now correctly groups concert ensembles and includes Indoor Percussion and Winter Guard.
*   ** and sub-pages**: A new section of pages was created for fundraising.  serves as a landing page with links/cards to individual fundraiser event pages like , , and . A  was also created for future use.
*   ****: This file configures Netlify CMS, defining content models for pages and data, enabling non-technical users to edit content through a visual editor.
*   ****: This file was added to ensure correct client-side routing for the single-page application when deployed on Netlify, preventing 404 errors on direct page access.
*   ****: Configured with the school's primary and accent colors, extending Tailwind's default theme to enforce consistent branding throughout the site. It also includes settings for glass-morphism effects.

The architecture emphasizes clean separation of concerns, with components handling UI, pages handling layout and data presentation, and JSON files managing content, all driven by React for a dynamic frontend experience.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently in the process of implementing the latest batch of user requests, which were detailed in Chat Message 163. Specifically, the most immediate work being addressed is updating the staff page to pull highlights from their biographies instead of full descriptions.

To achieve this, the  content file has already been edited to include or modify the necessary highlight fields. The next step, as per the AI engineer's thought process, is to update the  component to actually consume and display these newly structured highlights.

Concurrently, the AI engineer has also created the foundational files for several other new pages requested in the same prompt:
- 
- 
- 
- The  file was also modified to accommodate changes like adding the Our Program of Excellence blurb, altering the Elite Wind Ensemble blurb, and removing spirit store information. The plan to integrate the BOA New Jersey photo and Ocean Storage logo onto the homepage is also part of this ongoing batch of work.
